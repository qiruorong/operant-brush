## Rodent Behavioral Task: Necessity of Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1) in Stimulus Direction Discrimination
This repository contains scripts and configurations for constructing stimuli and managing the behavioral setup in a rodent experiment investigating the necessity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in discriminating stimulus direction. The experiment consists of four key stages: habituation, classical trials, operant trials, and optogenetic trials. This repository was established in March 2023 as part of Ruorong’s initial research project in the Emanuel Lab.

### Content
1. brush/ – This folder contains the current validated behavioral paradigm, successfully implemented in this project.
2. raspberry/ – This folder contains an alternative behavioral setup based on Raspberry Pi configuration. However, this approach was deemed unsuitable due to the lack of a reliable built-in real-time clock.
3. printhead/ – This folder documents an attempted setup using a custom-made printhead developed by Dr. This approach did not meet the experimental requirements for same reason.
